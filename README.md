I'm passionate about crafting sleek, minimalist, and modern User Interface.
just a beginner now, but aiming to be a pro coder!

Hey there! I'm **Jibreel Benjamin** or yall call me **El** from **28° Malang, Indonesia** 🇮🇩
a 17 yo- student with a big passion for front-end development i guess... Even though I dont have any industry experience yet, I love diving into web design, playing around with User Interface, and bringing ideas to life through code.
